Tajweed Colors are based on [Tajweed Quran (Easy Quran) Mushaf by Dar-Al-Marifa](https://easyquran.com/ar/) developed by Dr. Eng. Taha Subhi, Damascus - Syria. Tajweed Color Font Features on King Fahad Glorious Quran Printing Complex V4 Mushaf fonts were invented and developed by [Ayman Siddiqui](https://zoopernet.com) and co-developed by the team: Rania, Amena, Naveed Ahmed, Mohammed Zahid, Tooba, and Anza for Sadaqa-e-jaria (non-commercial) purposes only. Development was permitted with prior permissions secured from King Fahad Glorious Quran Printing Complex and Dar-Al-Marifa by the [Quran.com](https://quran.com) (Quran Foundation) team._

[2] _We express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who contributed to the Chinese word-by-word Quran translation, particularly Brother Ma Zhiren for his meticulous translation work completed in 2014, Brother Adam Voo from Malaysia, and [Brother Usama Nonnenmacher](https://drusaman.github.io/) for digitalizing the data, as well as Brothers Max Ma from Canada and Suleyman Abdullah from China for their collaboration. May Allah reward them all abundantly in this world and the hereafter. We pray that Allah blesses our Chinese brothers and sisters through the Quran app._

[3] _Original sources for the Malayalam translations are [Amani Thafseer](https://amanithafseer.com) and [Lalithasaram](https://www.lalithasaram.net/). For the Amani Thafseer translation, [Brother Usama Nonnenmacher](https://drusaman.github.io/) assisted in formatting the data and adjusting word splitting where knowledge of Malayalam was not required. Brother Ameen Abdussalam, whom he collaborated with via the Amani Thafseer team, provided crucial support for cases needing Malayalam expertise. Regarding the Lalithasaram translation, minimal adjustments were necessary beyond converting the format from an SQL file to a standard database file._

[4] _Special thanks to Bro. Sulayman Jamali for lending the Sindhi translation of Quran by Abdul Maalik Mayman, Bro. Abdul Aziz Korejo for digitalization of Sindhi translation, [Brother Usama Nonnenmacher](https://drusaman.github.io/), his parents and father-in-law Umar Farooq Quddusi and his sister for their contributions as a team to Sindhi word-by-word Quran translation._
