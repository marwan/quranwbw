## Test Execution Strategy

2. **Phase 2**: Implement critical user flow tests
3. **Phase 3**: Add core feature tests
4. **Phase 4**: Implement technical and edge case tests

## How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure the development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Install Playwright browsers (first time only): `npx playwright install`

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Or use Playwright directly
npx playwright test
```

### Running Specific Tests

#### Run a Single Test File
```bash
# Run all tests in a specific file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/chapter.basic.spec.ts

# Examples:
npx playwright test tests/e2e/audio.advanced.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/navigation.advanced.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/mushaf.mode.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/display.layouts.spec.ts
```

#### Run a Single Test by Name
```bash
# Run a specific test by its name (use --grep flag)
npx playwright test --grep "load chapter 1"
npx playwright test --grep "audio controls"
npx playwright test --grep "settings drawer"
npx playwright test --grep "bookmark persists"

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx playwright test --grep "navigation"
npx playwright test --grep "theme"
```

#### Run Tests for Specific Browser
```bash
# Chrome only
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Firefox only  
npx playwright test --project=firefox

# Both browsers (default)
npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox
```

#### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with headed browser (visible)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run with debug mode (step through)
npx playwright test --debug

# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test tests/e2e/chapter.basic.spec.ts --grep "settings" --headed --debug
```

#### Other Useful Options
```bash
# Run with different timeout
npx playwright test --timeout=60000

# Generate test report
npx playwright test --reporter=html

# Run tests in serial (one at a time)
npx playwright test --workers=1

# Show browser output/console
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium

# Run only failing tests
npx playwright test --last-failed
```

### Test Reports
```bash
# View HTML report (after running tests)
npx playwright show-report

# View trace files (for failed tests)
npx playwright show-trace test-results/[test-name]/trace.zip
```

## Notes

- Tests should cover both Arabic and English content
- Consider different screen sizes and devices  
- Test with different network conditions
- Validate against multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Include performance benchmarks where relevant
- Always ensure the dev server (`npm run dev`) is running before executing tests
